# Signal Delivery API Integration - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The MT5 Signal EA v9.0 has been enhanced to properly send signals to the Signal Delivery API. This document explains the implementation changes made to ensure reliable communication with the API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Delivery API Functions

Four new functions were added to `Signal_EA_v90_Main.mq5`:

#### `SendTradeExecutionConfirmation()`
Sends successful trade execution confirmations to the delivery API with complete trade details:
- Signal ID, symbol, order type, lots, ticket number
- Entry price, stop loss, take profit levels
- Execution timestamp
- Account information (balance, equity, currency, leverage)

#### `SendTradeErrorConfirmation()`  
Sends error notifications for failed trades with detailed error information:
- Signal ID, symbol, direction, attempted lots
- Error code and error message
- Account information

#### `CreateBaseJSON()`
Helper function that creates the base JSON structure required by the API:
- Account ID, signal ID, success status
- Error/success message, EA version, timestamp

#### `AddAccountInfo()`
Helper function that adds account information to the JSON payload:
- Current balance and equity
- Account currency and leverage

### 2. Enhanced HTTP Request Handling

The `SendHttpRequest()` function was improved with:
- Proper UTF-8 encoding for JSON data
- Detailed error handling for common HTTP errors (4060, 4014, etc.)
- Enhanced logging for request/response debugging
- Support for POST requests with JSON content type

### 3. Integration Points

Delivery confirmations are now sent at the following points:

#### Successful Trade Execution
```mql5
// After successful trade execution
SendTradeExecutionConfirmation(signal_id, mapped_symbol, EnumToString(mt_order_type), lots, ticket, "Trade executed successfully");
```

#### Trade Execution Failures
```mql5
// After failed trade execution  
SendTradeErrorConfirmation(signal_id, mapped_symbol, direction, lots, 0, "Trade execution failed: " + error_details);
```

#### Signal Validation Failures
- Invalid signal data (missing required fields)
- Risk validation failures (risk too high)
- Symbol validation failures (symbol not available)
- Lotsize calculation failures

## JSON Format

### Success Confirmation
```json
{
  "account_id": "123456789",
  "signal_id": "SIG_2024_001", 
  "success": true,
  "message": "Trade executed successfully",
  "ea_version": "9.0",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15 14:30:15",
  "trade_details": {
    "symbol": "XAUUSD",
    "order_type": "ORDER_TYPE_BUY",
    "lots": 0.590000,
    "ticket": 987654321,
    "entry_price": 2000.50000,
    "sl": 1995.00000,
    "tp": 2010.00000,
    "execution_time": "2024-01-15 14:30:15"
  },
  "account_info": {
    "balance": 5000.00,
    "equity": 5125.50,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "leverage": 100
  }
}
```

### Error Confirmation
```json
{
  "account_id": "123456789",
  "signal_id": "SIG_2024_002",
  "success": false,
  "message": "Symbol not available",
  "ea_version": "9.0", 
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15 14:30:15",
  "trade_details": {
    "symbol": "UNKNOWN_SYMBOL",
    "direction": "buy",
    "lots": 0.000000,
    "ticket": 0,
    "error_code": 4106,
    "error_message": "Symbol not available"
  },
  "account_info": {
    "balance": 5000.00,
    "equity": 5000.00,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "leverage": 100
  }
}
```

## Configuration Requirements

### WebRequest Permissions
The delivery API URL must be added to MetaTrader's allowed WebRequest URLs:
1. Go to Tools → Options → Expert Advisors
2. Check "Allow WebRequest for listed URL"
3. Add: `https://n8n.stelona.com/webhook/signal-delivery`

### Input Parameters
The EA includes the delivery API URL as an input parameter:
```mql5
input string delivery_api_url = "https://n8n.stelona.com/webhook/signal-delivery"; // Delivery API URL
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

### HTTP Errors
- **4060**: URL not allowed - Shows configuration instructions
- **4014**: Unknown symbol - Logs symbol error
- **Other errors**: Logs error code for debugging

### API Response Logging
- Request data is logged (first 200 characters)
- Response data is logged (first 200 characters)  
- HTTP response codes are logged

### Fallback Behavior
- If API call fails, the EA continues normal operation
- Error details are logged for troubleshooting
- No trading functionality is affected by API failures

## Testing

The implementation has been validated with:
- JSON structure verification
- Required field validation
- API documentation compliance check
- Error scenario testing

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Logs**: Check EA logs for delivery confirmation messages
2. **Verify URLs**: Ensure delivery API URL is in WebRequest whitelist
3. **Check Responses**: Monitor API responses for any error patterns
4. **Network Timeout**: Default 5-second timeout can be adjusted via `api_timeout_ms` parameter

## Compatibility

This implementation:
- Is fully compatible with existing v9.0 EA functionality
- Follows MQL5 best practices
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Uses the same logging patterns as the rest of the EA
- Conforms to the API documentation v9.2 specification

The MT5 Signal EA now provides complete delivery tracking and confirmation, ensuring reliable communication with the Signal Delivery API for all trade outcomes.
